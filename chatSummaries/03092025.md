# Notist Project Summary - September 3, 2025

## Project Overview

Notist is a multi-component desktop note-taking application with a modern architecture consisting of:

-   **Notist**: WPF desktop application (.NET 8)
-   **Notist.System**: Core system logic library
-   **Notist.Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript web frontend

## Recent Major Developments

### 1. Comprehensive Settings System

-   **Backend Integration**: Full settings persistence with JSON serialization
-   **Settings Store**: Reactive Vue store for frontend state management
-   **Settings UI**: Complete settings window with sections for General, Appearance, and Shortcuts

### 2. Keybind Remapping System (Latest Implementation)

-   **Dynamic Hotkey Management**: Runtime registration/unregistration of hotkeys in WPF app
-   **Interactive Recording**: Custom `KeybindInput.vue` component for capturing key combinations
-   **Real-time Validation**: Prevents conflicts and validates key combinations
-   **Backend Integration**: `AppConnector.cs` handles hotkey pause/resume during recording

### 3. Component Architecture Reorganization

-   **Folder Structure**: Organized Vue components into logical categories:
    -   `common/`: Reusable components (AppGrid, KeybindInput)
    -   `layout/`: Layout components (Window, WindowContainer)
    -   `feedback/`: User feedback components (Alert, AlertContainer)
    -   `header/`: Header-specific components
    -   `windows/`: Modal/window components (SettingsWindow)

## Technical Architecture

```

## Key Features Implemented

### Settings Management

-   **Hot Reload**: Settings changes apply without restart (where possible)
-   **Restart Warnings**: Clear indicators for settings requiring application restart
-   **Validation**: Input validation with user-friendly error messages
-   **Persistence**: Automatic saving with error handling

### Keybind System

-   **Global Hotkeys**: System-wide hotkey registration using Windows API
-   **Live Recording**: Real-time key combination capture
-   **Modifier Support**: Full support for Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Win modifiers
-   **Conflict Prevention**: Validates against existing system hotkeys

### User Experience

-   **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, error handling, success notifications
-   **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, clear focus indicators
-   **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout for different window sizes

## Technical Highlights

### Advanced Features

1. **Dynamic Hotkey Registration**: Runtime hotkey management without app restart
2. **Component Communication**: Structured connector pattern for clean separation
3. **State Management**: Reactive settings store with persistence
4. **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the stack

### Code Quality

-   **TypeScript**: Full type safety in frontend
-   **Component Organization**: Logical folder structure for maintainability
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, connectors, and system logic
-   **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized result types and error handling

## Development Environment

### Tools & Technologies

-   **Backend**: .NET 8, WPF, C#
-   **Frontend**: Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, SCSS
-   **Build System**: MSBuild for C#, Vite for frontend
-   **Package Management**: NuGet for .NET, NPM for frontend

### Key Dependencies

-   **WPF**: Modern desktop UI framework
-   **Vue 3**: Progressive web framework with Composition API
-   **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development
-   **Vite**: Fast frontend build tool
-   **SCSS**: Enhanced CSS with variables and nesting

## Current State

### Completed Features

✅ Complete settings system with persistence  
✅ Keybind remapping with live recording  
✅ Component organization and structure  
✅ Error handling and user feedback  
✅ Hot reload capabilities for settings

### Architecture Status

-   **Modularity**: Clean separation between components
-   **Extensibility**: Connector pattern allows easy feature addition
-   **Maintainability**: Organized folder structure and consistent patterns
-   **Performance**: Optimized build process and reactive state management

## Next Potential Iterations

### Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Advanced Hotkey Features**: Sequences, chords, context-aware bindings
2. **Settings Export/Import**: Backup and sharing of configurations
3. **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for third-party integrations
4. **Advanced UI**: Themes, customization, accessibility improvements

### Technical Debt

-   Consider implementing automated testing framework
-   Evaluate performance optimizations for large note collections
-   Review security implications of global hotkey system
